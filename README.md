# Brazilian White Rice Recipe

This is a simple HTML project created as part of my learning journey with web development. The project was built to practice HTML structure and semantic elements through a recipe format.

## 📚 Purpose

This project is part of my studies through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and it helped me learn:

- How to structure a basic HTML document
- How to use elements like `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<img>`, and `<p>`
- How to write clean, semantic HTML

## 🍚 About the Recipe
